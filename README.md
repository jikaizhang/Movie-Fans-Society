# Movie Fans Society

This is a Django social media website for movie fans like me to discuss anything about movies.

You can easily sign up and create or join a group. You can post in groups when you are logged in, but only approved posts will be visible to others.

Some packages necessary to run this project:
```
pip install bootstrap3
pip install misaka
```
This is what the home page looks like:
